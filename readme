Three files:


291labels.mat:

MATLAB mat file containing l2-normalized GLOVE word vectors representing 291 default IAPRTC12 tags.


l2_normalized_semantic_SVM_full_data_with_val_291labels_no_zero.mat:

MATLAB mat file containing l2-normalized training/validation/testing image features as well as their tags annotation.


fast0tag.py:

A ready-to-run python toy example on IAPRTC12 dataset. Should reproduce the same results we reported in our paper.


This example is for conventional tagging. However it should be easy to be modified into zero-shot senarios. you are welcome to modify it to run on your own dataset!
